# Solution.VirtualMind.Test
We are using .Net Core 3.1, C#, Linq, ORMs Dapper, Unit Of Work, Repository, Dependency of Inyections Patters, SQL Server, etc.

We should restore our database with any two steps:

1.- You can use the file ScriptDB.js and apply in SQL Server Studio Managements.

2.- You can use the file VirtualMind.bak and apply to restore database in SQL Server Studio Managements.

Please run our api Virtualmind.Test.APIServices in port 5000 or if you decided changed of port, also, you should changed in endpoint of App Angular.

Thank and Good Luck!

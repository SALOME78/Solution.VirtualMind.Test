# Solution.VirtualMind.Test
We are using .Net Core 3.1, C#, Linq, ORMs Dapper, Unit Of Work, Repository, Dependency of Inyections Patters, SQL Server, etc.

We should restore our database with any two steps:
1.- You can use the file ScriptDB.js and apply in SQL Server Studio Managements.
2.- You can use the file VirtualMind.bak and apply to restore database in SQL Server Studio Managements.

Thank and Good Luck!
